# Introduction
**Welcome to the Chatroom Simulator!**

The Chatroom Simulator is a Java application that allows multiple users to interact with each other through a simulated chatroom environment. With individual client windows, users can send and receive messages, while also being able to view messages from other participants. Additionally, a server window provides control over the server's connectivity, enabling seamless communication between users and displaying all sent messages.

# Motivation

The motivation behind this project stems from my goal to apply and reinforce my understanding of key concepts such as Collections, I/O Streams, and multithreading in Java. By working on a personal project that integrates these concepts, I gained hands-on experience in utilizing these important components of Java programming.

# Technologies
